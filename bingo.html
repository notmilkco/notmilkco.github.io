    <h1>NOTMILK! Enhanced Bingo:</h1>
    <p>
        This is essentially human bingo with perks.<br><br>
        we got the idea when one unnamed member<br>
        of the team wanted to be petty during a late<br>
        night raid, and made a "human bingo" card,<br>
        listing all of the things unnamed member A<br>
        was tired of hearing unnamed member B say.<br><br>
        a distraught member C decided to warn all<br>
        members involved that this could get toxic<br>
        if it kept going on for too long, and all<br>
        members invloved in the creation of the petty<br>
        3x3 bingo agreed.<br><br>
        We decided to not only<br>
        expand the contents/targets of the card to<br>
        include all members, but also made it dynamic<br>
        and scalable so that others could use it, and<br>
        here we are.

            This is essentially human bingo with perks.<br><br>
            we got the idea when one unnamed member<br>
            of the team wanted to be petty during a late<br>
            night raid, and made a "human bingo" card,<br>
            listing all of the things unnamed member A<br>
            was tired of hearing unnamed member B say.<br><br>
            a distraught member C decided to warn all<br>
            members involved that this could get toxic<br>
            if it kept going on for too long, and all<br>
            members invloved in the creation of the petty<br>
            3x3 bingo agreed.<br><br>
            We decided to not only<br>
            expand the contents/targets of the card to<br>
            include all members, but also made it dynamic<br>
            and scalable so that others could use it, and<br>
            here we are.

            <h2>HOWTO: Enhanced Bingo</h2>
            <p>
                All you need for your own spin of enhanced bingo is creativity and a willingness to stick to the rules you create consistently. Enhanced bingo goes a little something like this:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Write in the name of the Target (it could be a single individual, a company, or any other entity/mix of entities really) in the "_____ Enhanced Bingo" field.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>fill out each square (and optionally a free space in the center) of a 5x5 or larger odd-numbered grid.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>perks! we are constantly updating an example <a href="#perklist">list of perks</a> for you to choose from, but you can obviously come up with your own! make sure everyone's on the same page about what the perk you come up with entails if you choose that route.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
